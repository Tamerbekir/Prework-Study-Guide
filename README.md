# Tamerâ€™s Prework Study Guide

## Description

The Prework Study Guide consists of helpful tips when using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, using <strong>Git</strong> via a computer terminal, as well as Javascript. 

As a beginner to software engineering and a boot camp student, I was able to simultaneously learn how to code using Github, Visual Code Studio, and my computer terminal and create my own study guide webpage- as a way to look back and remember key points, notes, and helpful terms.

This study guide will be most helpful to those new to coding, such as using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>git</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>Javascript</strong>, as it will contain key terms, notes, and in some cases, a step-by-step followthrough to get something done. 

One can see what they can study first and see Javascript in action, by opening the Prework Study Guide in a Chrome browser, right-clicking on the Prework Study Guide page, scrolling down to <em>INSPECT</em> at the bottom, and clicking on <em>CONSOLE</em>. There, a list of topics will be displayed and a suggested topic will populate at the bottom!
